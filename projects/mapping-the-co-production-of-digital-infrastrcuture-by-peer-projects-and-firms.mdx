#Mapping the co-production of digital infrastructure by peer projects and firms

This research project, which focuses on the sustainability of digital infrastructure, aims to understand the social costs and benefits of the co-production of digital infrastructure by volunteer or ‘peer’ projects and commercial firms. We focus on organisational factors, such as developers being paid by firms to develop Free and Open Source Software (F/OSS).

Our primary research question is: To what extent are F/OSS projects supported by waged labour, and how does this affect project cohesion and sustainability? Our secondary research questions are:

- Aside from constitutional rules (e.g., limiting employee numbers in boards) what new practices, rules, and institutional logics emerge in peer projects?
- How do projects manage commercial objectives, how do firms manage communal principles, and what does this mean for employee loyalty?
