# How are COVID data infrastructures created and transformed by builders and maintainers from the open source community?

Open source data projects shape and define public knowledge about COVID-19. The COVID Data Infrastructure Builders Project uncovers the challenges in producing and maintaining these vital critical data infrastructures by focusing on the experts that design and maintain data trackers, portals, and dashboards for the public. The research team will investigate how community membership, work practices, and technical tools serve to support knowledge production about the COVID crisis. The project concentrates on how COVID data infrastructures can obscure or draw attention to the disparate impacts of the coronavirus amongst different communities.
