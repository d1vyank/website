# OSS as Digital Infrastructure: Legal Technologies & Institutional Design

Developing and maintaining open source software (OSS) relies on an
integration of the technical (e.g. the ways in which open source code is
engineered and maintained); the social (e.g. the communities formed
around particular OSS projects and their values); and the organizational
(e.g. formal OSS institutions, but also cross-cutting regulations, financing, and governance).

Consequently, legal and governance infrastructures shape how the digital
infrastructure of open source software is developed and maintained.
