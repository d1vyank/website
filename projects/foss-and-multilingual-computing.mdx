# How do open source tools contribute towards creating a multilingual internet?

This project investigates how open source tools contribute towards creating a multilingual internet. Open source software has been a common element and aspiration in the multilingual computing stack. This is in part because many minority language users were unsupported by, and thus opted to work outside of, proprietary systems. By exploring the use and value of open source software within multilingual computing, we can understand how current initiatives function and what challenges exist, whether they be in funding, expertise, interoperability, or otherwise.
