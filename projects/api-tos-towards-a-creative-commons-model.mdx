# How we can build a “Creative Commons” for API terms of Service, as a contract to automatically read, control and enforce APIs Terms of service between infrastructure and applications?

In order to scale technical, business and legal interoperability between digital infrastructures, APItos-CC project aims to  build a “Creative Commons” framework for API terms of Service, as a contract to automatically read, control and enforce APIs Terms of service between digital infrastructure and applications. The terms of service for APIs represent a boundary object whose identification of specific clauses and degree of "openness" (on the model of Creative Commons licenses with different degrees of conditions of use) can work towards a better understanding and vigilance.
