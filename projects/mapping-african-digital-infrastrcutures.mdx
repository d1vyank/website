# Mapping African Digital Infrastructures

African digital infrastructures: Evaluating the landscape,‚Äù will create a better understanding of African participation in open source development - an area in which there is relatively little existing research - and how African leadership and participation in open source projects could be enhanced. The interdisciplinary team will investigate the extent of African contributions to open source digital infrastructures, identify and understand catalysts of as well as barriers to the uptake and production of open source in Africa, document lessons from successful African-led open source projects, and reveal how digital infrastructures are different in the African context.
