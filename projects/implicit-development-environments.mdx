# Implicit Development Environments (IDE): Evaluating the needs of FOSS communities working on digital infrastructure

IDE explores the unique nature of the community that builds and maintains free and open-source software (FOSS) and the role that community takes in shaping an open Internet. It draws on interviews with contributors to FOSS projects to highlight the communityâ€™s strengths as well as its challenges.
