# Open Source in Public Service Delivery in India

India is on the path of rapid digitisation of its public service delivery infrastructure, ostensibly building on the countryâ€™s history of encouraging OSS use by the government. If built in a sustainable, rights respecting manner, on principles of openness, transparency, and accountability, digital public infrastructure can be immensely useful, and help reduce inequality in access to government services.

This project seeks to analyse the extent to which OSS principles are being incorporated into the development of public digital infrastructure for provision of government services in India, the challenges being faced in implementation, and the potential best practices that can be adopted by the Indian government.
