# Tech For Forests Update

In the period between the beginning of 2021 and the middle of 2022, [Narrira Lemos de Souza and her team](https://digitalinfrastructure.fund/projects/digital-infrastructure-vs-climate-change) investigated open-source digital infrastructures used by communities that are under the constant threat of violation of civil and environmental rights. Such infrastructure is composed mostly by applications used as tools assisting environmental protection activities. 

The research features a parallel investigation on two levels: that of developers, the creators of the tools that allow for the collection and manipulation of data; and that of users, who, besides mobilizing such data in favor of their communities, often are also the agents who input the data in the systems in question, such as deforestation records, forest fires, illegal mining, invasion of protected areas. 

To learn more about the research, they invite the reader to navigate [through their website](https://techforforests.org/).
