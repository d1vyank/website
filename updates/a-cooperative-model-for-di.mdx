# A Cooperative Model for Digital Infrastructure

Cooperatives are business owned and controlled by their members and workers.  Historically, cooperatives have provided essential goods and services through  sustainable management such as provision of natural resources like ground and surface  water, forests and fisheries. In later years, cooperatives have also shown their capacity to maintain technological complex infrastructure such as provision of sustainable energy  grids, especially from solar and wind sources. Following this, in the last decade, with the  growing trend of the information and communications sector, cooperatives have also  provided digital products and services, and more recently some of them have dedicated  themselves to the production and maintenance of digital infrastructure. To learn more  about how these cooperatives from diverse countries produce and maintain digital  infrastructure, we conducted research that taught us about their contributions to  different digital tools, libraries, frameworks and modules, essential for the provision of  thousands of websites and platforms. As part of the results we are offering some  recommendations directed to digital infrastructure projects that still may not have a  business model in the hope that they consider cooperativism as an option to help them  sustain their digital infrastructure projects.
