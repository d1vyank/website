# Tech For Forests Survey

Are you a developer involved with free/open-source projects related to humanitarian or environmental causes? Narrira Lemos de Souza and her team, who are working on [Digital Infrastructure and Climate Change](./projects/digital-infrastructure-vs-climate-change), have launched a survey and are asking for participants. Their research aims to understand the limits and scope of these infrastructures as a tool to strengthen the struggle of communities whose territories are threatened by illegal or predatory activities.

So, if you are a developer and contribute (or already have contributed) to some project along this line, please participate in our survey. The questionnaire contains both open-ended and multiple choice questions, and it takes about 15 minutes to complete.
